# -Forecasting-of-ATM-Transactions-in-the-UK-using-R
• I forecasted the ATM transactions for 14 days as a horizon based on the 3 years ATM transactions.
• Built multiple potentially suitable forecasting models, including a suitable Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, and Regression model to predict the 14 next values and then selected the best model from these models based on the RMSE value which was 5.49% (MAPE was 9.01%) for the best model which was ETS (MNM).
• Critically discuss these findings and choices in a technical report written in Markdown language.
